				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p class="text">Hey, I'm Matt. Well Matthew Holder, but I go by Matt. I was in the navy for 4 years. I had a good time, met alot of great people, learned alot of cool things and had some truly amazing adventures. However, it was time to leave. After all I had only joined the navy so that I could find out who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do and I had found it. Read my mission statement to find out what I decided.</p>

				<h2>Mission statement</h2>
				<iframe src="images/professional-pitch.mp4"></iframe>
				<p class="text">I don't like that so many people go without base necessities like food, water, shelter and medical care. For that reason, I've made it my life's mission to make these things easily accessable to as many people as I can possibly manage. I see robotics as the most efficient way to solve these problems, so my current goal is to learn to program responsive robots. I plan to accomplish this goal by October of 2021. My next goal will likely be changed by information learned along the way, but for now it is to learn to design and build actual robots for small tasks like dispensing items specified wirelessly. Although small, this goal allows me to dedicate larger amounts of time to full time employment; while still giving me the tools I need to move forward.</p>

				<h2>My Mantra</h2>
				<p class="text">The grass is greenest where you water it. Someone mentioned this once in a zoom call and I very much like what it intends to say. Essentially it's talking about effort. It says that if you spend you're life wondering how to get to the places with the best grass you'll only end up jumping around from place to place never doing anything really significant. If you instead find one place that has the a high potential for good grass, water it, feed it, and trimit when needed you won't have to go anywhere for the best. You've already made it.</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>Here I've got a list of my projects from code fellows.</p>
			<ul id="links">
				<li>
					<a class="pro" href="https://holdermatthew5.github.io/11lab-301/">Book app</a>
					<p>Book app was intended to give myself a deeper understanding of server side processes and introduce tools like postgresql and post/put/update requests.</p>
					<a class="pro" href="https://github.com/holdermatthew5/11lab-301.git">Github repo</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="pro">City Explorer</a>
					<p>The City Explorer app was intended to teach myself some basic information about building a server, the difference between front-end and back-end and the relationship between servers, APIs and clients. It's only a server, so there's no visible site to view.</p>
					<a class="pro" href="https://github.com/holdermatthew5/06lab-301.git">Github repo</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="pro" href="https://holdermatthew5.github.io/tidytrialsapp/">Tidy Trials</a>
					<p>The Tidy Trials app was a final group project for code fellows 201 course and is intended to allow users to keep track of chores as well as which ones need to be done and when, which ones have laready been done, and keep track of how much an individual has contributed to chores with a point bar.</p>
